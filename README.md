# Fashion_MNIST_Classification
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
The dataset was taken from kaggle's [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) and contained data with 10 categories T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker,Bag, Ankle boot.
The model was trained and saved using a deep learning model (made using keras and tensorflow) with 4 layers containing 784, 196, 49 and 10 neurons respectively with dropout layers. The model gave us an accuracy of 91.97% on the train data and a validation accuracy of 90.06% on validation dataset.
The model was then tested using OpenCV.
